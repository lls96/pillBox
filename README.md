# The Pill Box
For my rapid prototyping class, I did a semester long group project where we a designed and animated a smart pill box in AutoCAD. The motivation for this research project was to come up with a solution for people with Parkinson's and other related mobility issues. To see the research paper, which includes the full design process, please click above.
